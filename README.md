# cipherconverter
This is a program that encrypts and decrypts messages in both ASCII and a Caesar cipher. For the Caesar cipher, you just need the message and the shift key. For ASCII, you need the message or the values you want turned into a message. The table values for ASCII can be found here https://www.asciitable.com/. When you are decrypting ASCII, you must put a comma between the numbers, like this: 65,66,67 in order for the program to work.
